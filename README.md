## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- HTML vs Body: How to Set Width and Height for Full Page Size
- How to use CSS reset
- How to make a box semi-transparent

### Continued development

I would like to focus on how to work with flexbox and setting up background images with desired settings. I'd also like to know professional way of doing things rather than doing things randomly just because it looks alright.

### Useful resources

- HTML vs Body: How to Set Width and Height for Full Page Size (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-page-width-height/ ) - This is extremely helpful specially for a beginner web developer like me. I think everyone should have a look.
- How to use CSS reset (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8715860/what-does-mean-in-css)
- How to make a box semi-transparent (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Howto/Make_box_transparent)
